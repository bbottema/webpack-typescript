# webpack-typescript clean source demo

WebPack with TypeScript is a bit tricky to get working properly. There are two immediate issues that need to be solved fist:

1. In addition to TypeScript imports, WebPack needs extra `require` statements for every import to build the dependency tree for bundling. Otherwise, a module won't be packaged if the export is not used directly; for example if you only used a type reference during compile time ([stackoverflow.com: Webpack with typescript external commonjs module](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34657652/webpack-with-typescript-external-commonjs-module/34658780))
2. TypeScript won't understand `require` statements that are needed for webpack to build the dependency tree for bundling ([stackoverflow.com: typescript getting error TS2304: cannot find name 'require'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31173738/typescript-getting-error-ts2304-cannot-find-name-require))

This example project is a proof of concept that solves this problem using the [preprocessor loader](https://github.com/artificialtrends/preprocess-loader), so that you don't have to change your code at all to make this work properly.

## For the demo to work, clone this repo, then:
```
npm install
npm install -g webpack
webpack
```

Then open `index.html` and check that both ClassA and ClassB are packaged properly (they log a message in the browser console and are included in the bundle.js).

Verify that the `.ts` sources don't include the workaround scripts.

## What is happening

These imports exist in the code `entry.ts`:

```javascript
import ClassA = require('ClassA');
import ClassB = require('ClassB');
```

**First**, this is not enough for WebPack to understand it needs to always bundle `ClassA.ts` and `ClassB.ts`, even if the exports are not directly used, but only referenced. To fix this, we need to add extra WebPack-only imports:

```javascript
require('ClassA'); 
import ClassA = require('ClassA');
require('ClassB'); 
import ClassB = require('ClassB');
```

**second**, TypeScript will throw an error because it doesn't recognize `require` statements.

> ERROR in /home/ubuntu/workspace/project/src/entry.ts<br/>
> (3,15): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'require'.

To fix this, we need to declare `require` on top

```javascript
declare var require: any;

require('ClassA'); 
import ClassA = require('ClassA');
require('ClassB'); 
import ClassB = require('ClassB');
```

Now everything will work. 

## Automating the workarounds with the preprocessor loader

These steps are automated in this example project: using the preprocessor, it prepends every `.ts` source with a `require` shim and it modifies every line that contains an import using a regular expression.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module: {
    loaders: [{
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        loader: 'ts-loader!preprocessor?file&config=preprocess-ts.json'
    }]
}

// preprocess-ts.json
{
    "line": true,
    "file": false,
    "callbacks": [{
        "fileName": "all",
        "scope": "source",
        "callback": "(function fixTs(source, fileName) { return 'declare var require: any;' + source; })"
    }, {
        "fileName": "all",
        "scope": "line",
        "callback": "(function fixTs(line, fileName, lineNumber) { return line.replace(/^(import.*(require\\(.*?\\)))/g, '$2;$1'); })"
    }]
}
```

### Caveat

The regular expression to add require statements is very rudimentary (crude). The current version only works for the demo project where statements are `import something = require('module');`:

```javascript
return line.replace(/^(import.*(require\\(.*?\\)))/g, '$2;$1');
// import ClassA = require('ClassA');
// becomes:
// require('ClassA'); import ClassA = require('ClassA');
```

One more thing, notice all .ts files have an empty line at the end. This is needed due to a [pending bug in the preprocessor loader](https://github.com/artificialtrends/preprocess-loader/issues/1).
